# Standard-Cell-Library-Characterization
Designed and verified standard cells through netlist extraction, creation of DRC/LVS clean layouts, and LEF export for physical design integration. Further, characterized timing and power using PEX netlists, measured input capacitances, and generated .lib files to enable seamless library integration into digital design flows.
